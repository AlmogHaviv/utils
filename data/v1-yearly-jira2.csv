The Mash results showed that the 20895BG group is a highly heterogenic group as we also observed with Forester and NCBI taxonomy.  Their clustering together is probably due to a software error.

=> in MIC-1043 was defined the following rule which was applied in MIC-11743: on IGV the track should be called ""interpro7"" if the data presented for *.interpro/*.interpro7 file system files and ""interpro5"" if the data presented for *.interpro5 file system files; on UI should be displayed the latest version available in the production folder in file system.

*1.* During QA was revealed that productions from 14v versions have
<production_full_name>.interpro - older than interpro5
<production_full_name>.interpro5 => *Itai* added the following condition to the code to exclude files <production_full_name>.interpro that are older than interpro5:
if exists(interpro7):
....
elif exists(interpro) AND year >= 23:
....
elif exists (interpro5):
...

*2.* Correct version is presented on Genome Page and Cluster Page UIs (verified on IPR IDs level).
For details see *attached Summary_interpro_IP 21.03.2024_LR.xlsx*.

*3.* Issues to be completed:
 * opened MIC-1180: We don't recalculate the interpro annotation retroactively for all productions to align all of them to the latest interpro version.
To allow the interpro version to be displayed correctly in the UI for future interpro updates, the extension of the interpro annotation file must include the version. => to be fixed.

 * opened MIC-1174: remove IPR ids track and present only interpro descriptions track, change the track color to darker one. 

 * discuss with Itai and open task for May if required: understand why IPR id appears in the middle of description and change the format correspondingly to present it as desired on UI; discuss with Dudu and Itai if any Dev fix is needed following MIC-1180 and possible change in description format.;31/Mar/24 1:52 PM;larisar;10800",,,,,,,,,,,,,,14400,0,28800,200%,14400,0,28800,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MIC-1143,,,,,,,,,,,,MIC-1180,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"31/Mar/24 1:03 PM;larisar;Summary_interpro_IP 21.03.2024_LR-1.xlsx;https://jira.prod.evogene.host/secure/attachment/66908/Summary_interpro_IP+21.03.2024_LR-1.xlsx","31/Mar/24 1:03 PM;larisar;Summary_interpro_IP 21.03.2024_LR.xlsx;https://jira.prod.evogene.host/secure/attachment/66907/Summary_interpro_IP+21.03.2024_LR.xlsx","31/Mar/24 1:03 PM;larisar;Summary_interpro_IP 21.03.2024_LR.xlsx;https://jira.prod.evogene.host/secure/attachment/66909/Summary_interpro_IP+21.03.2024_LR.xlsx",,,,,,,,,,Development,,,,P273 - Product- Upkeep MB ,,,Computational,"1.

Fix Genome page main UI - Droplist Sequences & IGV - add interpro7 track DEV,MIC-1143,64804,Task,Closed,MIC,MicroBoost,software,larisar,,,Medium,,hodayam,larisar,larisar,18/Feb/24 10:47 AM,31/Mar/24 1:01 PM,09/Apr/24 6:45 AM,,27/Feb/24 12:00 AM,0,,,,"*Following MIC-1043 (Fix Genome page main UI - Droplist Sequences & IGV): algo work*

1. On IGV the track should be called ""interpro7"" if the data presented for *.interpro/*.interpro7 file system files and ""interpro5"" if the data presented for *.interpro5 file system files.

2. After the update and MB QA approval, all folders that have been generated already for ""Sequencies & IGV"" tab of corresponding Genome Pages should be deleted to enable re-generation of the folder which will include interpro bed file to be presented on UI.

3. RESEQ: The same adjustments must be made (section 1 above). Since the RESEQ folders have many additional files calculated by the BI RESEQ/SAUCE pipeline, it is not possible to simply delete the folder, but the change has to be made for interpro files specifically (there are only 2-3 bacteria that have RESEQ/SAUCE analysis).

4. [~hodayam], IGV track is also accessible through cluster page. Are the sections above cover IGV cluster page UI as well?

*DOD:*
1. [~hodayam], please confirm to make sure all of the above is feasible and we don't miss anything.
2. Please add Interpro7 track to appear on Genome page UI (droplist Sequences & IGV, RESEQ) and Cluster Page UI (droplist IGV) according to the definition in description.

In addition to this, it +*d**oes not appear in*+ ""successful"" Forester-generated trees (in either denovo-just user list or GTBB types), for example job id ed8f5404-cae1-461b-9de2-b6b1a8ea59c0 (denovo) or 78cd3744-183c-4590-b585-a294d0945222 (with pruned GTDB).
The user list in these 2 jobs included 151 productions, but in the final tree there are only 150, without notification to the user.


This is a problem for 2 reasons:
 # A production fails CorBac and Forester runs for unknown reason.
 # User receives a 'forester job done successfully' email, despite the above production does not appear in the final tree.

 # The reason for failing CorBac is identified.

 * GTDB-tk did not identify  the genes correctly - 119/120 genes are missng (number_missing_genes in *markers_summary.tsv*
 * Other bacteria from the Corbac job, that were not filtered have ><80% in MSA (% of columns with an amino acid), despite looking similar (# clusters, Busco, same specie).
 * Presumably, most productions that pass the BI QA will also be successful in passing GTDB-tk jobs.
 * In the history of Corbac results, only few other production were flagged (filtered.tsv file is usually empty)
 * No info found in the online on how to modify the MSA thresholds in GTDB-tk.

For now we are closing this bug - will question this production further to understand why it failed.

1. There are Multiple duplicate annotations of data within a track (EvoCOG/protein description for example)   - Why is that?

2. Popup windows in the UI - needs more annotations. We need to understand better where these annotations come from:
 * What do the different scores mean?
 * Variants - what do the fields mean
 * Domain - what is score? What is EVAL?

3. What is the cutoff for displaying the variants?  
 * The top summary row in each track (dark blue) not always displaying the alternation
 * 49762_scaffold59:252 - There is evident deletion in all sub strains, not just in 6/20 samples as appears in the SNP file
 * 49762_scaffold1:248250 Reads not annotated correctly
 * Example: Snps/sample - 77% considered ""variant"" - 59% not

4. SNP file: Arrange samples in numerical order: 01-20; Occurrence Column – number should be included - instead of ‘Jan-20’ – change to 1/20 to allow correct display in excel.

5. (redirected topic from MIC-1137):
The original LAV-394 SNP file has 145 alterations, in the current SNP file we have 177. NNN variants should be omitted (+other irrelevant variants) – This was done manually previously by IliaB and  should be automatically included in all runs to allow a suitable display or variants in the UI.

*DOD*: Following the meeting held on 16.01.2024 please answer following questions:

1. Please approve the meaning of “Not interconnected” in the table below (our assumption in the last column).
Please approve that the case ""PWY exists but not connected to RXN: *+PWY+* -{color:#DE350B}X{color}-  RXN – Protein"" is not exists in final files 
due to the addition of 1904 single RXNs (not linked to any PWY) which are now displayed as PWYs with single RXN (+within 5349 total PWYs in PWY2RXN file+), where the name of the PWY is identical to the RXN name (CPB-1012).
 !image-2024-01-17-12-25-33-299.png|thumbnail! 

2. There are 2 proteins that have full connection (and fasta) but for some reason are not connected in Protein2PWY:
 !image-2024-01-17-12-45-06-992.png|thumbnail! 
Please fix.

3. Number of Swiss-prot sequences in final file in the file system is *419,094* (not 424,819) (/{color:#0747A6}cpbclouds/central/databases/pathways/metacyc_custom/Proteins4structure_blast_one_line_fasta_minus_375_wt_RXN.fasta{color})

Please approve that delta between 424,819 to 419,094 is due to removed 375 MetaCyc prts without connection to reaction (according to the file name)?

4. Please check that the cut-offs are applied in the code: 
•	Structure association to  pathways: Gap filling: find additional pathway members for pathways with identified 50% ≤ RXN < 100% in 1st diamond blastp
•	MetaCyc pathways final out:

Thanks","23/Jan/24 4:51 PM;larisar;Following meeting MB:BI held on 16.01.2024:

1. Once KEGG annotation of isolate/metagenomic sample is completed, 3 relevant files for current issue are generated in the file system:

<production_name>.*ko* (fields: cluster, KO)

<production_name>.*kegg_pathways* 
(fields: pathway_id, pathway_name, modules_found, modules_total, percent_modules_found, module_ids module_names, ko_found, ko_totals, kos_ids, kos_names, kos_representatives, kos_abundance, kos_count)

<production_name>.*module* 
(fields: module_id, module_type, module_name, kos_found, kos_total, abundance, kos_ids, kos_names, kos_representatives, kos_abundance, kos_count)

2. <production_name>.*ko* 
is the only file from mentioned above uploaded into SQL DB. Connection to pathways to be displayed on UI is done as follows *cluster->KO->pathway* (see MIC-1011, MIC-1029, verified with Dudu).
<production_name>.*kegg_pathways* file is not used.

3. The hypothesis that was discussed: difference in the KEGG pathways count between file system and UI is due to direct connection in UI (*cluster->KO->pathway*), while <production_name>.*kegg_pathways* 
mapping is goes through modules (<production_name>.*module*).
+The hypothesis seems to be incorrect+ as could be seen in the attached file for map00405  [^lavie_prodid22923__Burkholderia_4944BG_11111ASM_20v1.kegg_pathways_updated.xlsx] .

MB currently decided to leave this task meanwhile since <production_name>.*kegg_pathways* file is not used for in ""Annotations"" UI where presented correct information, although  <production_name>.kegg_pathways do used for IGV viewer.
In the future <production_name>.*kegg_pathways* file generation should be re-checked to understand the delta.

Following [~duduz] check's summary (from MIC-778):

*I.* The common dataset of Metabacum and ClinicalDB has identical samples and number of samples.

One exception is for *PRJEB22863* :
1. *Metabacum* contains *186* samples named ERX2268212,ERX2268213,ERX2268214,.. etc.
2. *ClinicalDB* contains *219* samples named NSCLC_B_001_T0,NSCLC_B_001_T1,NSCLC_B_001_T2,NSCLC_B_002_T1… etc.
3. According to [~iliab] , a conversion can be done between these samples names. 
However, 186 is the correct number of samples.

*II.* The following datasets exists in Clinincal DB, but not in Metabacum:
|	PRJEB13680	|	NR, 16S	|
|	PRJEB13679	|	NR, 16S	|
|	Sheba	|	Sequencing data analysis In progress	|

|	PRJEB1220	|	Sequencing data was not analyzed/loaded (exists only in ClinicalBD)	|
Following meeting with Biomica held on 30.07.2023 revealed that there is a possibility that some DSs are named differently in Metabacum and ClinicalDB. The list above was sent to Biomica and we wait for the answer. (Healthy_pilot (clinicalDB==BIOM118(metabacum))

    1. Please verify that for each DS in ClinicalDB presented data only for samples having sequence data uploaded into metabacum and that all samples having sequence data uploaded into metabacum have data in ClinicalBD.

    2. Total number of samples under each criteria is = to the number of samples that have this criteria in the pipeline. 

    3. Based on above we will estimate if any additional work  required for the clinical db, like the following and based on request of raw file from Biomica:
       * Total number of samples uploaded is = to number of samples analyzed in pipeline
       * Check that number of metadata fields is = to what was received in raw files.
       * Reload all DataSets that were loaded incorrectly.

4. *PRJEB22863*:
* Biomica asked to load additional sample, ERX2268014, expected to be 187 in total. Opened task for BI (MIC-961).
* Biomica asked to rename the 187 samples in ClinicalDB to have the same names as in Metabacum according to their file ( [^Conversion_of_samples_PRJEB22863.xlsx] ).
* The delta (219-187=32) should be deleted from ClinicalDB. 

5. *BIOM148*:
This DS will have only Metabacum data since Biomica have no no data to provide for ClinicalDB.

6. Please rename *healthy_pilot* DS in ClinicalDB to *BIOM118* (same DS in Metabacum). 

7. For the datasets that don't have metagenomic data (Metabacum), please delete their clinical metadata (ClinicalDB data). See the list below:

Following [~duduz] check's summary (from MIC-778):

*I.* The common dataset of Metabacum and ClinicalDB has identical samples and number of samples.

One exception is for *PRJEB22863* :
1. *Metabacum* contains *186* samples named ERX2268212,ERX2268213,ERX2268214,.. etc.
2. *ClinicalDB* contains *219* samples named NSCLC_B_001_T0,NSCLC_B_001_T1,NSCLC_B_001_T2,NSCLC_B_002_T1… etc.
3. According to [~iliab] , a conversion can be done between these samples names. 
However, 186 is the correct number of samples.

*II.* The following datasets exists in Clinincal DB, but not in Metabacum:
|	PRJEB13680	|	NR, 16S	|
|	PRJEB13679	|	NR, 16S	|
|	Sheba	|	Sequencing data analysis In progress	|

|	PRJEB1220	|	Sequencing data was not analyzed/loaded (exists only in ClinicalBD)	|
Following meeting with Biomica held on 30.07.2023 revealed that there is a possibility that some DSs are named differently in Metabacum and ClinicalDB. The list above was sent to Biomica and we wait for the answer. (Healthy_pilot (clinicalDB==BIOM118(metabacum))

*DOD* (updated following Biomica's answers in MIC-954):

    1. Please verify that for each DS in ClinicalDB presented data only for samples having sequence data uploaded into metabacum and that all samples having sequence data uploaded into metabacum have data in ClinicalBD.

    2. Total number of samples under each criteria is = to the number of samples that have this criteria in the pipeline. 

    3. Based on above we will estimate if any additional work  required for the clinical db, like the following and based on request of raw file from Biomica:
       * Total number of samples uploaded is = to number of samples analyzed in pipeline
       * Check that number of metadata fields is = to what was received in raw files.
       * Reload all DataSets that were loaded incorrectly.

Some of these nurseries were preserved as enriched samples for metagenomes, so we can use the Microbiomes generated at that time.

We may need to go back to the Source Banks if there is nothing else. If you can locate these missing Microbiome Mixes, things will be much simpler.

The experiment will have 2 stages.

Stage 1 will be a calibration of the lab's protocols for surface sterilization of leaves to ensure that endophytes can be specifically identified and assayed from leaf tissue. We will choose an isolate picked from endosphere with distinct morphology, apply it foliarly to leaves in cotton GH, and collect leaves in bags. We will try 3 sterilization protocols (1% bleach, 0.5% bleach, and 0.1% bleach+70% ethanol), and 2 collection buffers (PBS and MES). All assays will be by plating on R2G plates.

Stage 2 will be a rolling validation assay with 20 isolates predicted to be endophytic, and 20 isolates predicted to not be endophytic. We will do about 3 isolates at a time, each week as possible. We will apply the isolates foliarly to 3 plants each in cotton GH, and incubate for 7-10 days. Then we will collect 2 leaves from each plant and surface sterilize, then collect endophytic bacteria and plate on R2G, and look for the applied isolate by morphology and/or 16S PCR.

Current Timetable:

Growth of calibration isolate (to be chosen in the comments soon) - 12 November 2023

Foliar application of calibration isolate - 19 November 2023

pseb is not yet installed so I used the old environment to run it on 1 sample and the result of the script is attached.

Some information regarding pseb:

H1=hydrophobicity H2=hydrophilicity

The hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity values are derived from the amino acid composition and sequence context, reflecting the protein's tendency to interact with hydrophobic or hydrophilic environments.

Higher values of hydrophobicity (H1) may indicate regions of the protein that are more likely to be hydrophobic and hydrophilicity (H2) may indicate regions that are more likely to be hydrophilic.

H1 & H2 each have 10 features due to the lambda parameter of 10 which means that the algorithm considers interactions between amino acids that are up to 10 positions apart in the protein sequence.

edit: attached new features table after updating pseb command

Can we then also run the ""best hit"" and its score for KO annotation, in addition to the Evocog annotation as we discussed?","25/Mar/24 7:24 AM;gala;[~erezn]

We don't have to have KOs for all the proteins.

The KO questions that we have are if you have specific KO annotation, or part of an enrichment list.

For those without any KO annotation the answer will be no. or zero.

I don't think we should change the parameters in the training set compare to the production, because it will not reflect the same thing in the model.","25/Mar/24 7:58 AM;iliab;I am also not sure about the accuracy of toxin representation in the KEGG database. ","25/Mar/24 8:10 AM;erezn;[~iliab] We are trying to find novel unknown proteins, not ones that are represented in annotated DBs, so this is fine IMO.

to do this, we are looking for as large as possible amount of features that may (or may not) represent these 'unique' unknown toxins. We are generating a list of properties that describe the TS - some of these features are KOs and EVOCOGs - so why not try to look at the best representation of this annotated positive/negative protein and then decide if to use it or not? 

I'm not asking to decide, just to look at the data. ","25/Mar/24 10:01 AM;iliab;Find attached the results of the manual blastp against EvoCOGs.

1.Splitting the tab - Ok, approved by users.


2. No.
ISID is isolate ID - a parameter from Lavie's isolate. It isn't identical to assembly_id which is a parametere from BI.

See here: [http://confluence:8090/display/ADQ/Isolate+page:]
 *Isolates IDs* - serial number given to isolate at submission to the Isolate Bank OR assembly ID from the BACUM.

*Assembly ID* - auto number given at loading of assembly (only Isolate / Matrix Source Types mentioned above) to the BACUM database.

3. All this data is available at isolate page (see [https://laviebio.prod.evogene.host/laviebio/dist/index.html#/isolate?id=13697)|https://laviebio.prod.evogene.host/laviebio/dist/index.html#/isolate?id=13697_]

I think it is stored at BA_Assemblies, but please verify with BI.","04/Feb/24 7:40 AM;noama;[~erezn]
In the link that you gave me 
 https://laviebio.prod.evogene.host/laviebio/dist/index.html#/isolate?id=13697
I can find some of the data bus there are few missing/ not clear fields

* #clusters, I don't see it or what fields display the data for this field?
* direct connection, I don't see it or what fields display the data for this field?","04/Feb/24 9:04 AM;erezn;[~noama] 
I believe all relevant data can be found in BA_ASSEMBLIES and U_PRODUCTIONS, but I think [~gala] should be your source of information for these questions.
As far as I understand, size in the isolate page is seq length.

[Direct connection|http://confluence:8090/display/ADQ/Isolate+page] - connection between Isolate ID to Assembly ID, i.e. genome was sequences directly from given Isolate ID.

I asked Gal if this parameter is still valid and where to find it. Waiting for her response.","05/Feb/24 7:03 AM;gala;Hi [~noama]  and [~erezn]

Isolate ID is source ID from BA_assembly_source

Sequence length is Length in BA_assemblies

#clusters I believe it's  cluster in U_prod_stats

Direct connection-

Today, this field is no longer in use as far as I know. It used to hold info regarding the Isolates- if it's from Isolate the source type would be internal, if 16S it would be indirect if matrix direct.

Let me know if I missed any of your questions

 

 ","05/Feb/24 7:29 AM;noama;[~erezn]

 Regarding your remark for direct connection (_Today, this field is no longer in use as far as I know. It used to hold info regarding the Isolates- if it's from Isolate the source type would be internal, if 16S it would be indirect if matrix direct._):

After Noam's update to the Conversion Tables, I am looking at data for this field and it seems as > 90% have the parameter 'direct', only a few hundreds have 'indirect' and a few hundreds are 'internal' - all of them from 2024 (24v1). Does that make sense? Is this field relevant? If not, the users should be notified.","08/Feb/24 12:25 PM;gala;Hi [~erezn]

As I wrote before, as far as I know, this field is no longer in use.

In the last 3.5 years that I'm in Evogene, I've never used it... So I really can't say if it makes sense or not.

 ","08/Feb/24 1:23 PM;erezn;[~gala] 
Ok, it seems that indirect = only 16S was sequenced:
[http://confluence:8090/display/ADQ/Isolate+page]

_16S - *indirect connection* between isolate ID and assembly using Sanger sequencing of the Isolate 16S. If the 16S is identical (99.5%) to genomic 16S from an existing assembly in the hierarchy._

So it makes sense that these are only old productions.
I wonder - should they be included as independent productions...? They are identical to full productions, even by name. only field that is different is the ISID:
!image-2024-02-08-15-21-43-301.png|width=1109,height=252!","08/Feb/24 1:31 PM;erezn;[~noama] 
Can you tell me from which table the field Direct connection is taken?
It is odd that all the 2024 productions have a different value in this field (Internal instead of direct).

 ","08/Feb/24 2:25 PM;gala;Hi [~erezn]

I don't know why you are also showing the 16S as productions. I would suggest not to show them as productions.

Regarding the 2024 productions- I think we added that manually, since no-one knew what it was.

Why are we insisting on this field?

[~Iliaz] FYI","11/Feb/24 4:18 AM;noama;[~erezn]
Direct connection field is taken from BA_ASSEMBLY_SOURCE","12/Feb/24 3:27 PM;erezn;[~noama] 
Thanks for the updates. After MB QA, please fix these minor issues in the conversion table, before we can close the task:
 * All Public Production Versions downloaded file – rename “Public Production Versions”
 * Production Versions file – rename – BACUM production versions
 * Rename the tab ""ALL PUBLIC PRODUCTION"" to ""PUBLIC PRODUCTIONS""
 * Busco score in both tabs – please round to 1 decimal digit (98.60000000000001->98.6)

Dudu said that this task is not clear.

Does it mean to move BLAST IP to Laviebio's environment or to update the old IP environment?

Also ''Please instruct Maria in how to run BLAST searches against this database"" is not clear.

Can you explain please?
Do you think we need a meeting to clarify all topics ?
Thanks","27/Dec/23 10:11 AM;shlomog;We had a meeting regarding this several weeks ago.

What I understood was that [~mariac] would be given a database of all Lavie patent sequences, either from [~Iliaz] (this is the subject of LAV-607, I believe) or compiled by myself.

She could then conduct off-line BLAST searches of this database as needed, as an alternative to using either the old IP environment or the Lavie environment.

If this explanation is still not sufficiently clear for either Dudu or yourself, then please schedule a meeting, and include [~michald] as well.","28/Jan/24 11:28 AM;Iliaz;Following discussion with Shlomo, I'm closing this issue as DONE.

Please see Inbar's comment above.
Abundance tables downloaded from UI seem to be the same we used for QA in INTBIOM-114.
May it be connected to refresh needed to be done in SQL tables (see CPB-1082) ?","15/Feb/24 10:42 AM;gala;Hi [~larisar]

As discussed  in our meeting, Dev team are looking into it.","15/Feb/24 12:39 PM;inbarp;[~gala] please approve/write your comments to the below summary of the problem we faced and what was done so far:

 

The user through the UI could not see the update of data of the abundance tables (corrected abundance tables that were uploaded to override the ones uploaded previously).

Once BI upload abundance tables for the *new DataSet* (DS) to SQL DB -> materialized view (SQL saved query) updated with the data and generates in the file system the folder corresponding to the DS; additionally, under the DS folder, the files containing abundance per DS sample are generated. When the user downloads abundance tables through UI, the files mentioned above are merged and downloaded as tsv format abundance table.

*NOTE*: In case a folder having the  DS name already exists or a file with corresponding sample name exists, they will be skipped and not be overwritten.

In case any correction of abundance table needs to be uploaded into SQL DB, the files containing abundance per DS sample which already exist in the file system must be deleted manually beforehand.

The corrected data uploaded to SQL DB will enter materialized view (refreshed automatically every 24h to fetch new uploaded data – fix to that was added by DEV in frame of current task) and the new files per sample will be written, leading to correct abundance tables fetched by the user through UI.

We will continue to address this problem & QA the system after more fixing under INTBIOM-147 and INTBIOM-148. ","19/Feb/24 10:19 AM;gala;approved",,,,,,,,,,

Some context about what we added:

After previous discussions where we decided to sum the taxa abundances from KRAKEN's 'level reads' to make the 'all reads' (accumulated abundance), we have noticed that for the rank of leaves, the abundance was not calculated properly, when different leaves would have the exact same name their abundance would get summed together when it shouldn't.
 So we added a case specific implementation to make sure that each leafs abundance is calculated on its own using its unique taxa id.

Results were approved by Biomica.

Also, I've compared the output table against the DB and got that all 4439206 records are exactly the same (24526 unique taxa for 181 samples) with the updated abundances.","31/Jan/24 11:49 AM;elanitec;[~liorr], thank you so much for the detailed summary!

Also they re-produced the fileד with clean reads that were missing
Regarding the statistics. I checked job 1705498469862. FDR did not show any Reject of H0. I think it is because the number of rows is 96899. Then alpha*i/96899 is too low and p-value cannot be smaller.
","25/Jan/24 7:36 AM;anatm;regarding ds-fdr, talked to Ruth Heller (one of author of the paper). She said that for around 30K genes (entities) she would use 100 permutations. We set the default to 200 and recommend to run a maximum of 1000. Biomica insists to run with 10K. I am afraid it might be too much in terms of (forcing the stat to give results when there are no results). On any case, there won't be many results if the stat does not find them.
I checked job: 1705498469862

After [~duduz] fixed the name of dataset BIOM118 in ClinicalDB, so the name would be identical in both Metabacum & ClinicalDB the problem was fixed.

After this fix, QA check perfomed by [~inbarp] was OK.

It was clarified by Dudu how the system works : system looks for intersection between samples of Metabacum and samples of ClinicalDB. As a result it's now clear that datasets IBS, HMP2 and SRP057027 are OK and no action should be taken regarding them.

",,,INTBIOM-77,,,,,,,,,,MicroBoost,"0|i01bh3:",Jan 2024,,,,,,,,,Bio-Info,,,"17/Jan/24 9:13 AM;gala;We run kraken again for SH_017_DKDL22001346 and got identical results in the kraken-bracken report (attached).

However, when we look at the abundance file, we noticed that there are few taxids that were present before, but are not present now due to the ""all reads count"" in the abundance calculation.

There are two abundance columns to kraken- level reads & all reads. As was agreed in previous discussions (Jira MIC-949/917), the all reads data was not calculated properly so we have decided to sum the level reads in order to create a fixed all reads count.

Thus, when summing level reads of leaves, we may get several taxas with a different count but identical ranks, which results in a shared sum (there are a total of 141 of 280671 leaves)

For example:

In the current sample, SH_017_DKDL22001346, when you are looking at leaves with the name ""CrAss-like virus sp."" you'll find three leaves:

0.00    62      62      L       42831617                        CrAss-like virus sp.

0.00    16      16      L       152831617                       CrAss-like virus sp.

0.00    3       3       L       82831617                        CrAss-like virus sp.

 

In the abundance table, they will appear as:

taxid      ranks     superkingdom   phylum class       order     family    genus    species  name     SH_017_DKDL220013466

12831617           leaves    Viruses Uroviricota          Caudoviricetes   Crassvirales         -              -              -              CrAss-like virus sp.               81

As you can see, all of the levels are exactly the same, the only difference is the taxid, the sum of all the reads (from the kraken bracken report) is 81, and it appears in all of the taxids with the same name- even those that didn't appear in the original report, but did appear in different samples from this dataset.

There are few options-

1. Leave it as is, since biologically, they are all the same strain, so the summing up is correct.

 

2. Change the sum of all reads so that it's done per sample, but then the sum will still appear in all the strain within the sample. Will look like that:

taxid      ranks     superkingdom   phylum class       order     family    genus    species  name     SH_017_DKDL220013466

82831617           leaves    Viruses Uroviricota          Caudoviricetes   Crassvirales         -              -              -              CrAss-like virus sp.               81

152831617         leaves    Viruses Uroviricota          Caudoviricetes   Crassvirales         -              -              -              CrAss-like virus sp.               81

42831617           leaves    Viruses Uroviricota          Caudoviricetes   Crassvirales         -              -              -              CrAss-like virus sp.               81

 

3. Not to sum at the strain level so that it will also take into account the taxid and to sum the reads starting from the species level: 

taxid      ranks     superkingdom   phylum class       order     family    genus    species  name     SH_017_DKDL220013466

82831617           leaves    Viruses Uroviricota          Caudoviricetes   Crassvirales         -              -              -              CrAss-like virus sp.               3

152831617         leaves    Viruses Uroviricota          Caudoviricetes   Crassvirales         -              -              -              CrAss-like virus sp.               16

42831617           leaves    Viruses Uroviricota          Caudoviricetes   Crassvirales         -              -              -              CrAss-like virus sp.               62

When filtering data in the table presented in the UI you can't see how many rows/results the filter yielded (like when you do it in excel), it's important since it can help us set up different filters.

 

After discussions we will use this solution:
 # First, check the possible to add links in TSV file via code (Python). If it is doable, [~robertoo] should create the entire results' file with links, and the UI will only download the results (with no table shown)
 # If adding links to TSV is too complicated, the flow will be:  The UI will show a query form instead of the table. ([~nira] , please define this form: Which fields should be queried? What kind of query?). On form's submissions, the query will be send to a job that will return the 1000 first results, and display them in a table, as currently displayed.",drorf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,57600,57600,,0%,57600,57600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,INTBIOM-95,,,,,,,,,,,,INTBIOM-72,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,P999 - General (LavieBio),,,,"1.

The app will be built of 2 tabs: Form and Jobs (as in other apps).

Will show a table of the jobs from Airflow with the following columns:

ID (download result ZIP file), Job name, User name, Selected VCF, Status.

In this phase we'll only give an option of download results, and won't implement a tree-view as in the old version.

 

+*The Form tab*+ (Very similar to current form):
 # Select VCF from a list. Currently the VCF list is stored in a DB table. We should consider if to keep it like that or just use it hard-coded. Also, a description should be added to each VCF. All VCF file will be located in a dedicated folder in /cpbclouds (Path should be supplied by BI team).
 # Choose a filtration method (See mockup) :   
 a. Upload a SNP file with format of tab-delimited of separated lines. Each line with SNP and location. In addition, give an option to load a sample list.  
 b. Choose filter parameters and values from a list (Will be supplied by BI).

Each assembly query is compared to ALL representatives from the DB.
In the comparison there are several conditions that are checked,
meaning that an output file containing information for why each assembly received NONE status will be n*m long (n=number of query assemblies, m=number of bacum reps).
We can't really summarize all the different comparisons to one main reason, it could be coverage related or genome length related, each comparison between query and rep can fail in different conditions.

Once all queries were compared to all reps, we check if we found a possible reference. If not, we check if the query can open a new group and receive NOVEL status based on its busco, n50 & tax16s which all have pre-defined values.

So, if a query assembly received status NONE it means that:
 coverage check failed against ALL reps AND query is not good enough to be NOVEL.
 OR
 coverage check passed against SOME rep BUT a red flag was found (based on genome length and n50)
Otherwise, it receives status NOVEL if all the comparisons failed but the genome is good enough to create a new group.
Finally, if coverage check passed against rep AND no red flags were found, the query will join the representative's group.

I will add a summarized description in the pipeline's confluence: [Link|http://confluence:8090/display/CG/BACUM]","10/Mar/24 7:37 AM;iliab;Thanks! ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since EvoCOG.rep.map.ko was modified by [~itair] it contains now two different patterns of the EvoCOG references: 

i) Standard pattern of name|version|cluster - Halobiforma_lacisalsi_AJ5|14v1|WP007140342_P1

ii) Short pattern for the sequences without production (name|cluster) - Aigarchaeota_archaeon_JGI_0000001_B8|ASPG01000001G2_P1

2) I reversed changes in Refunder (reverse ""temporary changes to finish Sheba run"" commit).

3) I am currently verifying whether all the sequences from EvoCOG.rep.map.ko have identical names in EvoCOG.rep.fasta.

 ","15/Feb/24 12:34 PM;iliab;3) ... 8,642 reference clusters from EvoCOG.rep.map.ko are not present in EvoCOG.rep.fasta (/cpbclouds/laviebio/workarea/iliab2/CPB-1169/Not_connected_EvoCOG.rep.map.ko). 

It is not critical since multiple references are pointing to the same KO. 

Some of these derived from the duplicated productions (622 productions in LavieBio). These 8,642 references were removed from the EvoCOG.rep.map.ko file. 

fgrep -vFwf /cpbclouds/laviebio/workarea/iliab2/CPB-1169/Not_connected_EvoCOG.rep.map.ko EvoCOG.rep.map.ko > NEW_EvoCOG.rep.map.ko

8,812,791 reference clusters are common between EvoCOG.rep.map.ko and EvoCOG.rep.fasta. 

4) EvoCOG.rep.fasta contains duplicated sequences. It is not critical but can be fixed in the next update of the file. 

5) cluster2evocog_ko_map.py is changed so EvoCOG.rep.map.ko will receive references with version ([runannotation-1.0.147|https://gitlab.prod.evogene.host/tools/runannotation/-/tags/runannotation-1.0.147]). ","21/Feb/24 7:32 PM;iliab;6) We found a list of incomplete or created by-mistake productions.

1. When we download the data from the UI, does it take the data from the DB (mbac_taxa_abundance) or does it have an intermediate table/files?

If it has a table/files how do we refresh them when loading data?

Please check the data for Sheba and 744 if we need to refresh them (where uploaded at the end of Jan/beginning of Feb)

 

2.  After loading the taxa abundance to metabacum, we want to add a step that will check that the data was uploaded correctly.

To do so we need to access to the data through API, and currently it is not working well and we get different results each time we run it.

This is what we currently have:

filter =

We use it here:

[https://gitlab.prod.evogene.host/tools/loaders/-/blob/master/src/getTaxaAbundFromDB.py]

Currently we have a problem with downloading the abundance tables from metabacum UI (both raw and relative abundance) since they are too big and requires manual refreshing.

We want to change the download of the abundance tables from the metabacum UI, so that it will take the tables directly from the file system according to the path indicated in the file that is used to upload them.

 

Discussed solution:
 # Add a overnight triggered MV refresh
 # Build a DAG that will run overnight after step 1 is done:

 * Ping the DB to one in a while to check if the refresh is done
 * Get DS list
 * Run (parallel) all the samples built scripts (Each script for DS/analysis/entity)

This code is based on the old code but gets a bed file instead of json as an input, together with a vcf file, and outputs a filtered bed and a summary of grna-vcf intersection (as well as the raw intersection).

Process_one_row.py was modified to have an option to filter out gRNAs that have SNPs in them, by adding functions from vcf_grna_bulk_evocrispr.py between run_tabix() and run_softwares(). The code also outputs a summary table of the filtered out gRNAs with their possible SNP location and frequencies.

היי אמיר, מור ורבקה,

מצורפים שני קבצים:
 # Evo_crispr_final_exact_rows- הקובץ הזה מכיל את הגיידים עבור המטרות ששלחתם. תכננו את הגיידים לפי הקורדינטות ששלחתם, כך שלמעשה עבור כל אקסון תכננו 3 גיידים, ותוכלו לבחור בהסתמך על הציון של החיזוי ולתעדף את האקסון הראשון אם תרצו.

שימו לב, שעבור הגן השני (MrDN55013), לא הצלחנו לתכנן אף גייד ספציפי, ולכולם יש ציון off-target של 1 (עמודה T בקובץ אקסל). כלומר ככל הנראה יש העתק של הגן הזה בגנום (טכני או אמיתי) וגם הפריימרים היו כאן בעייתיים, והצלחנו לתכנן פריימרים רק עבור האקסון הראשון.

לכן בדקתי באופן ספציפי את כל הגיידים האפשריים עבור גן זה (ולא רק את ה-3 הטובים ביותר שאנחנו מספקים בתוצאות) וראיתי שישנו רק גייד אחד שאין לו off-target זהה בדיוק, והוא לא נבחר כי הציון של הon-target שלו יחסית נמוך. התוצאות שלו מצורפות בקובץ הבא
 # Evo_crispr_final_exact_rows_one_gRNA – הקובץ הזה מכיל את הגייד הבודד שהציון off-target שלו לא היה 1. הקובץ הזה ערוך בצורה *ידנית*, היות והציון שלו נמוך ולא נבחר בתוכנה. מכיוון שהאקסון הראשון יחסית קצר, והוא האקסון היחיד שהצלחנו לתכנן עבורו פריימרים, אני מניחה שאפשר יהיה להשתמש באותם הפריימרים שיש עבור הגיידים בטבלה הראשית. אבל כאמור לשיקולכם, הספציפיות של הגייד לעומת היעילות החזויה שלו.

אם משהו לא ברור, אנא כתבו ואשמח לענות.

תודה,

The code works fine, as the definition of the application is to find molecules that are non-Novel comparing them to the required pesticide table. Moreover, it provides in the output the molecule that is the closest one in the pesticide table.

Had the problem been defined to provide the novel molecules, the resulting table would be different.

If the user wants to find the molecules that are novel, we can add a small script that does the difference between the molecules found (non-Novel) and the input table. But this requires a separate task definition.

The interaction score is 0 if any group value is 0, while it should be like that only for groups that were defined as 'Must'

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In details:

The interaction score should be calculated based on the interactions of each group:
 # If a group was defined as 'Optional', for each group with a number of interactions larger than 0, a value of '1' is added to the interaction score
if groupx>0
than interaction_score+=1   
 # If a group was defined as 'Must', and it's value is > 0, than 1 will be added to the interaction score (as in the previous case). However, if this group's value is 0, the interaction score will be 0, regardless of the other values.

In the application, it seems that all the groups are treated as 'Must' even if they were defined as 'Optional', so it turns out that most of the molecules receive an interaction score of 0.

Please check that and change the code so it will calculate the interaction score correctly also for cases in which an 'Optional' group value is 0.

Target Selector script to find the paralogs and orthologs of relevant proteins- Feb,CHEM-908,63628,Task,Closed,CHEM,ChemPass,software,hamutal.e,,,Medium,,markb,gala,gala,31/Jan/24 5:13 PM,28/Mar/24 11:17 AM,09/Apr/24 6:45 AM,,06/Feb/24 12:00 AM,0,,,,"Comment from CHEM-854

 
I hope what I suggest is doable, please advise.

We need a broad protein sequence similarity calculation to see conservation in evolution.

But we do not want to look all over the species. Therefore we need to narrow the proteomes to taxonomic relevant species, like we can see in evolve. Say select 300 related proteomes for example. 

Once we do the 300 proteome, we do  sequence aliment. From them we take proteins with at least 50% identity, Say we got 100 proteins from all the species. Now we take the 100 proteins and do the conservation calculation.

We will later need to do calculation of the conservation of the binding site amino acids.

 

 

In addition we have standard proteomes we refer to, and do all the calculations above on them as well. 

Drosophila

E coli

Saccharomyces

Bee

Arabidopsis

Human

The homolog search results for your evaluation are in the directory: K:\ChemPass\Target Selection\mafft_res
The directory contains the following files:
1. pre_mafft: a list of sequences for msa from model organisms (with threshold 20 % identity and taxonomicaly proximate (4th level of taxonomy subtree from the end) organisms  at similarity level 50%.
The amount of sequences is restricted to 50 (for not impairing the msa procedure. However, I see it may be increased.
2. The same as 1, but without model organisms
3. mafft - the results of multiple sequence alignment of ""pre_mafft"" data. 
4. mafft  - the results of multiple sequence alignment of ""pre_mafft50"" data.

The conserved positions are signed with symbols (*,|,:). The general and position-specific conservation score will be supplied in a work on CHEM-907. 

I am working now on CHEM-895.

Points for discussion:
I restricted the amount of homologs by 50 the best, sorted by the identity level.
Probably, the more correct way is to control receiving only one sequence from each organism, to escape paralogs of one organism to be included instead of ortholog of other. I am going to correct this.

Thanks,

Mark","11/Feb/24 12:15 PM;boazm;Thanks Mark,

It is indeed important to have only the best example from each organism. 

 

 

+few questions:+

Does the process connected to DAGs?

The alignment outputs are giving the name of the genes, we need the species as well.

Does the reference protein located in the first line? please include the full name of the reference protein.

Where do you place the total number of paralogs? what is the identity cutoff?

According to Schrodinger's knowledge-base article, it is recommended to *include metal-binding states of compounds* when preparing compound DBs with *LigPrep*.

However, the preparation process of the CHEMUNITY molecules didn't generate these states, since these states do not normally have significant populations at physiological pH.

In order to include these metal-binding states among the prepared variants, an appropriate parameter should be added to the preparation command.

In order to avoid changes in CHEMUNITY DB, we will add a bypass in the DAG - ligand preparation using EPIK to produce states suitable for metal binding.

This step will come after the pharmacophore screen and chem limits filtering.

If subsequent computations will be done (i.e. ActiveSearch or DeepDock):
 # The PointHit results will be converted to states suitable for physiological pH.
 # Before performing docking of DeepDock or ActiveSearch results, a conversion to ""metal binding states"" will be performed.

=> Please add an option in PointHit DAG to take into account ligand ionization states that are suitable for metal binding.

Please help me understanding the output.

In the excel, tab ""full pipeline"", we get the full picture. To what information column ""foundRXN_structure"" refers?

For example,  I want to look at the 63 cases that indicated to have structures, only 34 of them have information in the ""individual mapping of prts tota"" tab. If we do take for example  PWY0-1297 at line 631. It is relate to XP_004931469.1. 

Going to NCBI ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/XP_037876362.1)] there is no indication to PDB structure. 

How can I find information about the proteins. And where can we find the structures?

Thanks

Boaz","21/Jan/24 9:10 AM;iliab;Hi [~boazm],

The Metacyc pipeline has two parts. One is a regular blast against the Metacyc database, and the second is finding missing reactions in the already found pathways. We use structural analogue approach to fulfil not complete pathways. ""foundRXN_structure"" is a number of reactions found with the second (structural) approach. ""foundRXN"" is a number of reactions found using the regular blast approach. As you can see the portion of ""foundRXN_structure""  is always bellow or equal to 50% of total reactions in the pathways.

The second approach does not look directly at the 3D structure of the query proteins but rather uses the precalculated set of structure analogues to the Metacyc database. Briefly, we blast the query protein against a large db with a precalculated structure similarity to the Metacyc database.

Including compounds' metal-binding states in Full PointHit,CHEM-878,60863,Task,Closed,CHEM,ChemPass,software,hamutal.e,,,Medium,,robertoo,hamutal.e,hamutal.e,25/Dec/23 1:26 PM,28/Mar/24 11:15 AM,09/Apr/24 6:45 AM,,11/Jan/24 12:00 AM,0,,,,"*The binding site of the first fungicide target contains a zinc ion that binds to the ligand* (the ligand makes two coordinations with the zinc).

According to Schrodinger's knowledge-base article, it is recommended to *include metal-binding states of compounds* when preparing compound DBs with *LigPrep*.

However, the preparation process of the CHEMUNITY molecules didn't generate these states, since these states do not normally have significant populations at physiological pH.

In order to include these metal-binding states among the prepared variants, an appropriate parameter should be added to the preparation command.

In order to avoid changes in CHEMUNITY DB, we will add a bypass in the DAG - ligand preparation using EPIK to produce states suitable for metal binding.

This step will come after the pharmacophore screen and chem limits filtering.

If subsequent computations will be done (i.e. ActiveSearch or DeepDock):
 # The PointHit results will be converted to states suitable for physiological pH.
 # Before performing docking of DeepDock or ActiveSearch results, a conversion to ""metal binding states"" will be performed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=> Please add an option in PointHit DAG to take into account ligand ionization states that are suitable for metal binding.

These states will be produced by Epik.

The change will be also implemented in the UI:  CHEM-877

I hope what I suggest is doable, please advise.

We need a broad protein sequence similarity calculation to see conservation in evolution.

But we do not want to look all over the species. Therefore we need to narrow the proteomes to taxonomic relevant species, like we can see in evolve. Say select 300 related proteomes for example. 

Once we do the 300 proteome, we do  sequence aliment. From them we take proteins with at least 50% identity, Say we got 100 proteins from all the species. Now we take the 100 proteins and do the conservation calculation.

We will later need to do calculation of the conservation of the binding site amino acids.

 

 

In addition we have standard proteomes we refer to, and do all the calculations above on them as well. 

Drosophila

E coli

Saccharomyces

Bee

Arabidopsis

Human

Following a conversation with Noam from Dev, the problem was probably due to uploading of taxonomic data for sheba 2023 that was done on the same time the bug was encountered.

As the upload of data was finished successfully, the bug was fixed.

when looking at in the samples data and statistics file from the Sheba dataset, there are two samples with extreme analysis features. 

 

These are-

SH_017_DKDL220013466 in all analyses.

A_302_DKDL220013467 in the Refunder analysis.

 

It is important to stat that these samples are not unique in terms of sequencing quality, sequencing depth and clinical phenotype.

Please run them again in the problematic analyses.

 

Additionally, when going over the assembly statistics, the N50 values of this dataset are relatively low. 

When comparing the N50 values with PRJNA762360 (the assembly from last year) in samples with the same sequencing depth, the N50 is more than 5 times higher.

These are the only two dataset that were analyzed with the same assembler.

Can you please check this?

 

 

Thank you,

The summary attached here (INTBIOM 124)for A_302_DKDL220013467 from Michal:
Refunder was ran again for this sample and it looks like the differences are of roughly the same power. 

For Kraken analysis on Sheba data-SH_017_DKDL220013466, please note the summery from Gal (INTBIOM 125):
We run kraken again for SH_017_DKDL22001346 and got identical results in the kraken-bracken report (attached).

However, when we look at the abundance file, we noticed that there are few taxids that were present before, but are not present now due to the ""all reads count"" in the abundance calculation.

There are two abundance columns to kraken- level reads & all reads. As was agreed in previous discussions (Jira MIC-949/917), the all reads data was not calculated properly so we have decided to sum the level reads in order to create a fixed all reads count.

Thus, when summing level reads of leaves, we may get several taxas with a different count but identical ranks, which results in a shared sum (there are a total of 141 of 280671 leaves)

For example:

In the current sample, SH_017_DKDL22001346, when you are looking at leaves with the name ""CrAss-like virus sp."" you'll find three leaves:

0.00    62      62      L       42831617                        CrAss-like virus sp.

0.00    16      16      L       152831617                       CrAss-like virus sp.

0.00    3       3       L       82831617                        CrAss-like virus sp.

 

In the abundance table, they will appear as:

As you can see, all of the levels are exactly the same, the only difference is the taxid, the sum of all the reads (from the kraken bracken report) is 81, and it appears in all of the taxids with the same name- even those that didn't appear in the original report, but did appear in different samples from this dataset.

There are few options-

1. Leave it as is, since biologically, they are all the same strain, so the summing up is correct.

 

2. Change the sum of all reads so that it's done per sample, but then the sum will still appear in all the strain within the sample. Will look like that:

taxid      ranks     superkingdom   phylum class       order     family    genus    species  name     SH_017_DKDL220013466

82831617           leaves    Viruses Uroviricota          Caudoviricetes   Crassvirales         -              -              -              CrAss-like virus sp.               81

152831617         leaves    Viruses Uroviricota          Caudoviricetes   Crassvirales         -              -              -              CrAss-like virus sp.               81

42831617           leaves    Viruses Uroviricota          Caudoviricetes   Crassvirales         -              -              -              CrAss-like virus sp.               81

 

3. Not to sum at the strain level so that it will also take into account the taxid and to sum the reads starting from the species level: 

taxid      ranks     superkingdom   phylum class       order     family    genus    species  name     SH_017_DKDL220013466

82831617           leaves    Viruses Uroviricota          Caudoviricetes   Crassvirales         -              -              -              CrAss-like virus sp.               3

152831617         leaves    Viruses Uroviricota          Caudoviricetes   Crassvirales         -              -              -              CrAss-like virus sp.               16

42831617           leaves    Viruses Uroviricota          Caudoviricetes   Crassvirales         -              -              -              CrAss-like virus sp.               62

When trying to run a funda job on the Sheba dataset, in the ""create input"", the number of samples is the total number in the sheba dataset (181 samples), on both groups. this means that there is no interleave between the clinicalDB and metabacum.

I am attaching here a table with the different datasets and their raw data files and locations.

We are missing files from 3 datasets, that can be re-downloaded from NCBI:

Please download the missing files from the the relevant datasets.

Please sate the size of the samples of each dataset.

After that, we would like to transfer all the datasets to Biomica.

If no information regarding the adapter sequences is present, please describe what information was used for each dataset to clean the raw reads.

 ","29/Jan/24 8:15 AM;sharonl;Hi [~SheerliK]
The data is about TB8.5. Can you bring Roman a flash drive that we can move the files to? 
thanks","29/Jan/24 3:46 PM;SheerliK;Hi [~sharonl],

Is the 8.5TB compressed data? please add _MD5 checksum_ for all samples as they will be transferred and perhaps unzipped at Biomica.

Our hard drive has enough space for 8.5TB. With that said, Biomica uses this hard drive frequently so please write when to provide the hard drive and how long do you presume the transfer will take.

I'm reminding you please to find- If no information regarding the adapter sequences is present, please describe what information was used for each dataset to clean the raw reads.

 

Thank you,

Sheerli

 

 

 

 ","31/Jan/24 5:52 PM;gala;Hi [~SheerliK]

Yes, all the files are .gz

We will add MD5 checksum to the samples, and will prepare the data for transfer using your hard drive. We will let you know when it's ready so that it would be as fast as possible. I can ask roman for time estimation, but I assume it also depends on the hard drive itself.

Regarding the adapters, we don't have the records for the old data sets.

Improve De-Novo model for APTH12 .Prd .Mar24,AGPI-47,65610,Task,Closed,AGPI,Ag Plenus Internal,software,drorf,,,Medium,,hamutal.e,hamutal.e,hamutal.e,29/Feb/24 1:34 PM,31/Mar/24 1:51 PM,09/Apr/24 6:45 AM,,29/Feb/24 12:00 AM,0,,,,"20.2
 After long discussions between Evogene and AgPlenus during Feb about how to improve APTH12 de-novo model, we've decided to perform changes that may improve the model in a way that will generate molecules with specific properties.

The following table summarizes the upcoming tasks which will be performed by Algo and AgPlenus teams. Part of tasks will be part of CHEMPASS dev.
|*Comments*| ** |*Action Item*|*Owner*|*Due Date*|*Pending*|

| ** |8|Combine new Phloem Mobility predictions in the De-Novo model|Roberto|04/24|7|

 

 

 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Begining of Feb definitions:
 Improve De-Novo model, so it will generate closer analogs using two optional approaches:
 # representing the chemical structure by: scaffold + similarity + the existence of  a 'Sulfonamide like' group in the molecule
 # using experimental results (in-vitro, in-planta) to refine the features that the model should be based on.

DOD: the model will generate new molecules that are closer analogs to the initial hit

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+*Previous tasks:*+

Apply the _De Novo_ algorithms for APTH12
 Scaffolds must be represented.
 * Training data was generated by agPlenus and Roberto using ActiveSearch, focused PointHit and DeepDock 
 * Data organization and Deepdock model generation - Algo (Roberto)
 * De-novo model generation - Algo (Roberto)
 [If there are not enough molecules with the relevant scaffolds, a workaround approach will be applied by Roberto].

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Preparations (Done):*

Data preparation for de novo model generation:

APTH12:
 # ActiveSearch resulted with over 5M compounds
 # Focused PointHit
 # DeepDock model generation 
 # Focused PointHit on DeepDock results 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The _De Novo_ algorithm for  APTH12 will be applied in several ways:*
 * 4 trainings for APTH12:
 ## With scaffold; similarity to AG18583 (specific fingerprints and similarity cutoff, Dice metric); cLogP around 2.7
 ## Without scaffold; similarity to a given compound  (specific fingerprints and similarity cutoff, Dice metric); cLogP around 2.7
 ## With scaffold; with given SMARTS; cLogP around 2.7
 ## Without scaffold; with given SMARTS; cLogP around 2.7

The results of these 4 jobs will be compared.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The molecule that AgPlenus wants the DeNovo tool to suggest analogs around in the APTH12 project is AG18583

SMILES: COc1cccc(C(N(CC2)CCN2c(cc2)ccc2NS(C(F)(F)F)(=O)=O)=O)c1

SMARTS:

aa([Br,Cl,C,O])aa-C(=O)-AAAA-*aa[$(a~[N-]S(=O)=O), $(a~*~[N-]S(=O)=O), $(a~**[N-]S(=O)=O), $(a~*([-])=[N]S(=O)=O), $(a~**([-])=[N]S(=O)=O), $(a***~[N-]S(=O)=O), $(a~***([-])=[N]S(=O)=O)]

Pointhit of the deep dock predicted molecule is running. 

Despite of the apparent success in finding new molecules a deeper analysis of the results brings some doubts about the efficiency of the procedure involving an intermediate preparation of the molecules. The analysis below is for the highest docking score pose per varName, which is kept despite the new preparation:
 * there are only ~1% of the molecules have the expected epik_metal_binding flag.
 * 9% of the molecules are a duplicate variant from a molecule in that also appears in the original canonical smile form.
 * From the remaining molecules ~35% have different canonical smiles (all determined using schrodinger therefore probably comparable) from the starting molecule before going preparation again (out of which 2.6% are duplicated).
 * 56% have the same canonical smile as the initial variant

From the above results I suspect that the whole procedure is missing the molecules it aims at, i.e. the molecules with special ionization around the metal, in case there are many like that. It also points to some discrepancy between the variants that comes out of the pharmacophore search and the ones that appear optimal in the docking. 

Please remember that the pharmacophore containing variants were generated with version 2018-1 and the current ones are generated with version 2022-2. This also may add some variability to the available variants.

Perhaps we should explain these results to AgPlenus team.

 ","25/Jan/24 8:27 AM;hamutal.e;Based on the above, we've sent some questions to Schrodinger's support, according to the response we received, we understood that we are handling the metal states properly and we can count on the results

(3) With scaffold; with given SMARTS; cLogP around 2.7 
(4) Without scaffold; with given SMARTS; cLogP around 2.7 For each of the two projects, the results of these 4 jobs will be compared.

*Definition of done:* For each of the 8 De Novo jobs, an sd file will be returned containing the docked De novo produced compounds, including the following scores for the generated compounds: docking score, cLogP, and synthesizability score(s). 
For APTH7, ActiveSearch resulted with ~1.8M compounds. Following Focused PointHit Roberto will run DeepDock to find more relevant analogs. APTH7 runs with scaffolds are using a workaround that considers the rings but not the linkers.

Despite of the apparent success in finding new molecules a deeper analysis of the results brings some doubts about the efficiency of the procedure involving an intermediate preparation of the molecules. The analysis below is for the highest docking score pose per varName, which is kept despite the new preparation:
 * there are only ~1% of the molecules have the expected epik_metal_binding flag.
 * 9% of the molecules are a duplicate variant from a molecule in that also appears in the original canonical smile form.
 * From the remaining molecules ~35% have different canonical smiles (all determined using schrodinger therefore probably comparable) from the starting molecule before going preparation again (out of which 2.6% are duplicated).
 * 56% have the same canonical smile as the initial variant

From the above results I suspect that the whole procedure is missing the molecules it aims at, i.e. the molecules with special ionization around the metal, in case there are many like that.","25/Jan/24 8:22 AM;hamutal.e;Based on the above, we've sent some questions to Schrodinger's support, according to the response we received, we understood that we are handling the metal states properly and we can count on the results","25/Jan/24 8:26 AM;hamutal.e;We understand there is a problem in the preparation process since it creates duplicates - different variants may have the same name.
