Preface
The 14th edition of Industrial Research Laboratories of the United 
States represents the continuance of a publication long considered to 
be invaluable as a record of scientific development in American industry.
The National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council initiated
and published the first eleven editions. The twelfth edition (1965) was
the first to be published by the R. R. Bowker Company.
The directory contains information on 6661 laboratories belonging 
to 3241 organizations. The listings are limited to nongovernmental 
laboratories devoted to fundamental and applied research, including 
development of products and processes. Most of the laboratories are 
owned and operated by industrial firms, but also entered are some uni­
versity, foundation, and cooperative laboratories having separate re-
search facilities.
The majority of entries have been compiled from data provided by 
the organizations. When a company did not respond to several requests 
for information and its R & D effort was known to be of sufficient magni­
tude to warrant inclusion, an entry was constructed from public sources. 
To insure accuracy, proofs of all organizational outlines were sent to 
company officials requesting final verification prior to publication.
The editors have made a concerted effort to reproduce the material 
as accurately and completely as possible within the confines of format 
and scope. However, the publishers do not assume and hereby disclaim 
any liability to any party for any loss or damage caused by errors or 
omissions in Industrial Research Laboratories of the United States, 
whether such errors or omissions result from negligence, accident or
any other cause.
Gratitude is expressed to the companies who contributed thousands 
of manhours completing the questionnaires, particularly those who pro­
vided detailed reports on research facilities of large and diversified
vii

organizations. The editors gratefully acknowledge a competent and
cooperative staff who painstakingly solved the problems that developed
in the course of the compilation, and who contributed so much to edi­
torial policy and procedures. Special recognition is extended to Nina 
Bricker, staff editor and graduate engineer, who assigned the subjects
for the index to research activities.
Suggestions and content evaluations are invited. Correspondence 
should be directed to The Editors, Industrial Research Laboratories of
the United States, P.O. Box 25001, Tempe, Arizona 85282.

Format and
Content of Entries
The directory follows a single alphabet format. Except in cases where 
the companies requested otherwise, divisions have been listed alpha­
betically below the headquarters or parent company entries, and in some 
cases under those entries which describe designated central research 
establishments. Subsidiary entries follow divisions, with foreign lab­
oratory divisions listed last within each corporate group. Divisional 
entries are preceded by one dash and entries of subdivisions by two or 
more dashes to show reporting responsibility.
Cross-references are entered alphabetically for all divisions and sub­
sidiaries with individual names belonging to another corporation.
A code, consisting of the letter under which the company is alpha­
betized and a number indicating its chronological position within that 
letter grouping, precedes the parent company name. In a few instances, 
material received after the numbering was completed was assigned a 
double letter and the number of the preceding entry so the company 
could be placed in alphabetical sequence.
Each divisional level and research facility is preceded by a decimal 
number. These numbering codes are used in the Geographic, Personnel, 
and Subject Indexes to refer the user to the appropriate text entry. The 
small letter codes to the right of each entry indicate the type of activity 
performed by each facility. Page footnotes provide the key to this coding.
In general, basic content of individual entries follows the same pat­
tern established for previous editions. Name, address, telephone num­
ber, officers of company and, where applicable, divisions or subsidiaries; 
name and address of laboratories with names and titles of chief admin­
istrative and research executives; number of professional staff and num-
XI Format and Content of Entries
ber with doctoral degrees, followed by disciplines of R & D responsibility. 
The entries end with a statement of chief R&D activity. Detailed items 
do not appear in every entry since many companies have policies which 
restrict publication of certain information.
All facilities listed are indexed geographically under the city and state 
in alphabetical sequence. The Personnel Index is an alphabetical ar­
rangement of all names included in the entries; no additional personnel 
have been listed in this edition to comply with the request of the com­
panies themselves. The Subject Index is an important key to the general 
R&D activities at each installation. Numbers in all the indexes refer to 
the number of the text entry, not the page number.
