min_rep_min_range = 5
min_rep_max_range = 40
opt_functions = 4000
The code calculates for each function, how many productions have it. Then based on different threshold values, it counts how many functions will be inserted to the analysis if the threshold of minimum productions for entity is between the min and the max range. 
Then it finds what is the value of this threshold that will produce number of functions that is the closest to opt_functions.

 # extracts the cluster information ffrom the SD file using *$SCHRODINGER/utilities/proplister,* where *$SCHRODINGER* is the /cpbclouds/central/software/schrodinger2022-2. The way to apply this tool has a lot of examples in the schrodinger_tools git project.
 # *$UNITY_ROOT/PythLibSchr/split_scaffold.py* - (python2 script of schrodinger) this code splits the Sd file into sets of different scaffolds (orÂ  different clusters). There is an option --useCSK (chemical skeleton). I think this was implemented in the old version of the clusterization, before rewriting, and I suspect it is deprecated. Need to look into this further.
 # *$UNITY_ROOT/poseviewer_interactionsEVOplus.py* - (python2 script of schrodinger) this code is the interaction filter code. It looks that this part is exactly the interaction filter run. I think you can use the output of pointhit instead of rewriting this part.

 *$**UNITY_ROOT**/python/tools/AgChem/hierarch_cluster_molecules.py)* also because the schrodinger implementation has bugs.

 # Concatenate the sd files that come from 7 (4 -7 are run in parallel for each cluster). At this stage it selects the cluster representative by sorting the values and also calculate statistics (histogram) on the cluster."

I will deliver a presentation on Wednesday, but I don't think I'll be able to refer to all the details, so I'll just answer here what I know:


1) look at the *.fstatÂ  file (created in Reseq). they are simply a results of ""samtools flagstat""Â  command.

2) there are some other filters, please have a lookÂ  here: [http://confluence:8090/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=47153243]Â (under ""Detailed parameters information) , also [http://confluence:8090/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=47153243&focusedCommentId=53542944#comment-53542944]

3) add the *.bam files to the IGV and choose ""show coverage track"".

4)-Â  freebayes_filtered.vcf: filtered results by the parameters I mentioned above.
- freebayes_filtered_norm.vcf: see here [https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html#norm]Â 
- I don't know the 3rd file (filter_norm_without_Ns), I think maybe it is not a result of Reseq/Sauce but of some manual manipulation.

5) the distances are calculated by the number of shared alleles (=same mutations in every 2 samples).Â sample_distances_shared_alleles.tsv show the raw number andÂ sample_distances.tsv is the same number divided by all alleles.

6) the SNPs are detected by sequence comparison to the reference genome, no need for anything else; but you won't be able to know what is the affection of those SNPs on functions (genes, evocogs...) without annotations.



7) I think a PHRED score of 15 should be enough, maybe even less, but I'm not an expert :).


8) I guess an ambiguous base, but I really don't know whatÂ  ""SAUCE_no_Ns"" is.


I hope that would helpÂ

However I found a bug in the transformation software of the schrodinger new version in the part that interfaces the RDKit. When one fixes *just a part of a ring* the mask is lost for subsequent transformations on the same molecule. So, since we first do bioisoster and then ring transformations, not all fixes remain active in the ring transformations. This is not the case if one selects a whole ring, as far as I checked.

Â 

This bug does not exist in the older version, due to a different selection scheme (atom isotope over atom property).

I just rerun it on /cpbclouds/laviebio/app_data/prod_report/1674721723060again and it finished smoothly on a quite short time.

Probably there was some local issue with the server at the time she run the application, and I could not reproduce it.

Does the 'not available' statement mean that the annotation was not done for this production?

If yes, maybe we should mark it as 'X' (as opposite to the 'V')?

Also, In this task's scope we will just check if the production was annotated with the various annotations, but NOT if the annotation was loaded to DB (so in case, we have a 'V' for a specific annotation' but no results, we will check it manually if the results are empty or wasn't loaded for some reason)."

Once the file was selected, we will take the list of the categories and expose a 'Assign categories colors' which will open a popup dialog that let the user to choose a color from a dropdown list for each category. This action is MUST. Otherwise, the submission will be disabled.

The black color is still reserved for 'none' category (blank category in the file).

RXN2Proteins

Â 

2) 1904 single RXNs (not linked to any PWY) are now displayed as PWYs with single RXN where the name of the PWY is identical to the RXN name.

1) acc2name will be duplicated to acc_to_name for both Biomica and Laviebio. Each newly downloaded genome will be added to both tables at the same time during the acc2name pipeline. Lior, can you please add this change to the acc2name pipeline?Â Comparens pipeline currently already uses acc_to_name.Â 

2) Newly downloaded genomes should be unique in acc2name. Currently we remove duplicates manually before downloading new GCFs if needed. In general, acc2name contains duplicated names. We have a Jira to remove themÂ -Â CPB-953.Â 

3) I can adapt Bactana 1 to use acc_to_name.

[~Iliaz]Â and [~liorr], do you agree?

The old samples were probably ran with stringency 0, I can add this change for all metagenome samples if it is suitable.

Changing the evalue cutoff doesnt change the results much, unlike stringency which gets us more results the lower it is."

The second column is the number of reads covered by the clade rooted at this taxon ('*all_reads*')

The third column in number of reads assigned directly to this taxon ('*level_reads*')

Currently, the script sums and filters the taxas abundance by their 'level_reads' column, BUT when checking previous datasets results it seemed like the filtration was done on the 'all_reads' column. (meaning if the script filters by 'level_reads' we got less final results)

To check that, I ran 4 different scenarios of kraken on *BIOM148* and 4 different taxa_abundance_tables are attached:
 * BIOM148_*old_db_all_reads*_abundance_table.txt - using the old DB and filtering by 'all_reads'
 * BIOM148_*old_db_level_reads*_abundance_table.txt - using the old DB and filtering by 'level_reads'
 * BIOM148_*new_db_all_reads*_abundance_table.txt - using the new DB and filtering by 'all_reads'
 * BIOM148_*new_db_level_reads*_abundance_table.txt - using the new DB and filtering by 'level_reads'

From the results we can see that if we run the new script with 'all_reads' filtration we get results similar to the existing ones + some more (from the new DB).
 We think that the pipeline should sum and filter the results based on the 'level_reads' column, even if we get fewer results.
 If the inclination is to to stay identical to previous results than we should switch to filtering by 'all_reads'.

We should discuss this further to decide how to continue, once we have decided the right course of action I will rerun the taxa abundance pipeline to create the updated results."

1. One can run the script not on special image, but only on complete directory of an experiment with experiment map and other files in constant directories, if running the 3 images means to run the script on experiment 12170 and 12173 so - no problems.

2.  ""integrate the results to the experiment map file"" - does it mean that you don't like the file Results.xlsx, that I provided by any reason?
In general, updating of the input files is not so good idea, by the following reasons:
a. it can appear to be problematic due some restrictions in user permissions.
b. any small mistake can spoil the input data.

Here's a comparison between these runs and the old run:

The main differences are:

- The new code filters by coverage and by [db priority, score].Â 

- In the old annotation code there was no such filter and there was also a GOterm annotation.Â 

Since we would anyway like to use the filters for production annotation now, and also stop using GOterm, there shouldn't be many adaptations if any for the annotation usage."
