Following meeting held on 06.03.2023 several points were raised (see below). 
 1. Talked about KEGG pathways only.

2. Definition of pathway exist/not exist in given metagenomic sample:
 should be defined *cut-off*, i.e. % of different KOs identified in the pathway in the sample (without taking in account abundance of each KO). 
 [number of different KOs identified for a given pathway in the sample]/[total number of expected different KOs for a given pathway] =*{color:#de350b}?{color}*.

3. Approach to define cut-off in section 2 above:
 For defined samples set (5-10) with different read depth, different functional (KOs) diversity and different functional (KOs) richness ([~SheerliK], please supply such samples) should be built histogram in the following way:
 * x axis is % of different KOs identified in the pathway as described in section 2.
 * y axis is number of pathways identified in the sample.
 * bins of 5%.

4. *Normalization*:
4.1 Summarize raw abundance of different KOs identified per pathway for each sample (abundance calculation according to the current calculation method thus, raw KO count = raw KO abundance). See attached slide summarizing current raw abundance calculation.
4.2 Pathway abundance calculation: 
 [sum of raw abundance of all different KOs identified in the pathway in the sample]/[total number of expected different KOs for a given pathway]
4.3. Normalization across samples will remain currently done; libsize and sample rank.  
4.4 *BIOMICA* - Please provide samples for analysis.


*Note: Following completion of MIC-797, raw KO abundance may change to:
 raw abundance of KO = sum of reads mapped to the ORFs normalized to ORF length and mapped to the same KO. 
 This will be addressed in a different JIRA.

*CURRENT JIRA WILL ADDRESS BULLET 4*

Hi Elanite, 
As I cannot comment In the Jira, I'm writing you this email. 
The columns in the file look OK. 
My only comment is that the file also contains eukaryotic KEGG pathways which we asked BI to remove in the past for our KEGG metagenomic analyses. 
This is for example- map05166-""Human T-cell leukemia virus 1 infection"". I attached the original file that contains only pathways included in our KEGG metagenomic analyses. 
Please remove the unwanted KEGG pathways from the file, as they are not included in our analyses and do not appear in our final KEGG pathway matrices. 
Thank you,
Sheerli


[~liorr][~iliab], please see attached file with KEGG pathways from Biomica. As Sheerli wrote, in email (I also verified this orally with her), they would like only the listed pathways in the attached file to be presented in the pathway analysis output file.  These are the pathways that are relevant for them. Can this be done?
Please let me know.

 Please perform calibration of the 1st step (reads mapping to the ORFs):
 1. Please map clean reads of each sample to each of the ORFs created from the assembly.
 2. The mapping of the reads may be performed using Bowtie2 or BWA, both with default parameters. 
 Please report the tool, tool version and parameters used. 
 3. Please check 2 approaches:
 * The reads need to be mapped to an ORF *unambiguously*: if a read is mapped to more than one ORF using the *algorithm cut-offs* it should be discarded and not used in the counts calculation.
 This means that unmaped reads, secondary alignments, supplementary alignments or any other ambiguous aliment should be removed.
 * The reads need to be mapped to an ORF using the *algorithm cut-offs*. This means that if read maps to more than one ORF all should be counted.
 4. [~SheerliK], please supply 5-10 samples with different read depth, different functional (KOs/EvoCOGs) diversity and different functional (KOs/EvoCOGs) richness. *A file with samples' names and the datasets they belong to is attached.*

לעשות מיפוי לcontigs  & paired ends. בbowtie2  יש גם אפשרות לעשות מיפוי של paired   ו-unpaired  יחד, ככה נוכל לראות גם את הנתונים של הunpaired .

The aim of this task is to gather and unify relevant data by ALGO team to enable DEV team to present it properly on UI.

The focal EvoCOG is the annotation of the focal gene (cluster page UI). Productions list under focal EvoCOG (production carrying focal EvoCOG) should be checked for functional neighborhood around focal EvoCOG. 

 The functions (EvoCOGs/KOs) will be arranged downstream and upstream relatively to the focal EvoCOG. 

A visual graph will be presented with a list of productions and their functions (arrows) that are exist in the defined region.

*The algo duties are:*

*1.* For each production, the genes’ (arrows) will be organized according to the order, orientation and proportional gene’s length in the selected region.

*2.* Partial genes on the selected region borders will be presented and partial end should be marked.

*3.* Please save actually extracted region per production to report it later (for example: 10kb). This is especially important if available region (kb) is shorter than that defined by the user.

*4.* Calculate the Functional Identity score of the other bacterial genomes to the focal production genome according to the following equation:

          ([the number of *nr function* in the defined region which are *identical* to the focal production function] /

          [total number of the focal production functions in the defined region])**100*

          +nr function+: Function will be considered as ""one"" even if it appears more than once in the defined region of a specific production.

*5.* Organize productions in the table according to a Function Identity score (descending). Productions having same Function Identity score will be arranged according to their bacterial names.

*6.* Function Distribution will be presented in page:

([[nr appearance per production] * [number of productions in which the function exist]] / [total number of productions per UI view])**100*

*7.* Please save following data:

       a) ID and description of each function (EvoCOG/KO).

       b) Information from the bed file regarding each gene (cluster_name, chr,from,to,strand) in the defined region.

*2. Please complete productions generation for 262 genomes.*
The list could be found in the ""list to complete productions"" tab of the attached summary file (column A). 
These genomes (except 2 mentioned below) expected to have production since they were representatives in the currently used StrainDB version (2019) but they have no actual production in DB (maybe they have production but it was not loaded for some reason - I didn't check).
2 of these genomes have ""QA comment"": generate_prod:missed_genome_re-check_busco. They had busco above 95 on genome level, but failed due to prt_busco=0. This failure does not make sense. 

*3. Delta change in value of genome_busco (calculated during creation of StrainDB_2022) and prt_busco (calculated during RunAnnotation)*.

First I had to create a kraken.prod.map file, since we already created productions of the new representatives and didn't want to use the old script.

I searched for productions in the db and added missing productions from the old kraken.prod.map file (we should remember to fix those in the DB since it seems like they don't have the GCF accession under the source field in U_PRODUCTIONS).

Then I've manually created a new version in MBAC_KRAKEN_VERSIONS (41) after having Noam run the following to get that number: 

select MBAC_KRAKEN_VERSIONS_SEQ.nextval from dual;

I'm currently running kraken_taxonomy_loader to add all the representatives with the new version. This should automatically allow the following file to be updated by F2O (will check tomorrow):

/cpbclouds/biomica/app_data/f2o/straindb/productions.txt

Following meeting held on 06.03.2023 several points were raised (see below). 
 1. Talked about KEGG pathways only.

2. Definition of pathway exist/not exist in given metagenomic sample:
 should be defined *cut-off*, i.e. % of different KOs identified in the pathway in the sample (without taking in account abundance of each KO). 
 [number of different KOs identified for a given pathway in the sample]/[total number of expected different KOs for a given pathway] =*{color:#de350b}?{color}*.

3. Approach to define cut-off in section 2 above:
 For defined samples set (5-10) with different read depth, different functional (KOs) diversity and different functional (KOs) richness ([~SheerliK], please supply such samples) should be built histogram in the following way:
 * x axis is % of different KOs identified in the pathway as described in section 2.
 * y axis is number of pathways identified in the sample.
 * bins of 5%.

4. *Normalization*:
4.1 Summarize raw abundance of different KOs identified per pathway for each sample (abundance calculation according to the current calculation method thus, raw KO count = raw KO abundance). See attached slide summarizing current raw abundance calculation.
4.2 Pathway abundance calculation: 
 [sum of raw abundance of all different KOs identified in the pathway in the sample]/[total number of expected different KOs for a given pathway]
4.3. Normalization across samples will remain currently done; libsize and sample rank.  
4.4 *BIOMICA* - Please provide samples for analysis.


*Note: Following completion of MIC-797, raw KO abundance may change to:
 raw abundance of KO = sum of reads mapped to the ORFs normalized to ORF length and mapped to the same KO. 
 This will be addressed in a different JIRA.

Hi Elanite, 

As I cannot comment In the Jira, I'm writing you this email. 
The columns in the file look OK. 
My only comment is that the file also contains eukaryotic KEGG pathways which we asked BI to remove in the past for our KEGG metagenomic analyses. 
This is for example- map05166-""Human T-cell leukemia virus 1 infection"". I attached the original file that contains only pathways included in our KEGG metagenomic analyses. 
Please remove the unwanted KEGG pathways from the file, as they are not included in our analyses and do not appear in our final KEGG pathway matrices.

 * The reads need to be mapped to an ORF *unambiguously*: if a read is mapped to more than one ORF using the *algorithm cut-offs* it should be discarded and not used in the counts calculation.
 This means that unmaped reads, secondary alignments, supplementary alignments or any other ambiguous aliment should be removed.

Currently we mapped with *bowtie2* using the *--local* parameters (local alignment; ends might be soft clipped; sensitive).

-----------------------

SHORT DESCRIPTION

From [Alignment using Bowtie2 | Introduction to ChIP-Seq using high-performance computing (hbctraining.github.io)|https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-ChIPseq-flipped/lessons/04_alignment_using_bowtie2.html]:

By default, Bowtie2 will perform a global _end-to-end read alignment_, which aligns from the first to the last base of the read. a _local alignment mode_, which, in contrast to end-to-end alignment, ignores portions at the ends of the reads that do match well to the reference genome. This is referred to as *soft-clipping* and allows for a more accurate alignment.

-----------------------

USAGE IN EVOGENE AND OUTSIDE

In PRISM I calculate coverage with the --local parameter (copied from the ""old"" code).

Here we mapped reads to genes which are much shorter (in average) to scaffolds. 

These two protocols use default bowtie2 parameters (end-to_end) to calculate coverage of the scaffolds.

[Metagenomics - SAMtools: get breadth of coverage|https://www.metagenomics.wiki/tools/samtools/breadth-of-coverage]

[Week 5: Mapping with bowtie2 — Carleton Bioinformatics documentation (carleton-bioinformatics.readthedocs.io)|https://carleton-bioinformatics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/protocols/week5-2021-mapping.html#]

----------------------

I think that given the character of the data (genes and not scaffolds) and the fact that the bias (if present) will be uniform across the samples, --local parameters should work here. However, if you want us to map using the default parameters (end-to-end) let us know ASAP. We already have the code to do it. 

 

 

 ","22/May/23 1:07 PM;iliab;We are planning to do additional bowtie2 run with the following parameters (maximal stringency):

 
||Parameter||Explanation||
|--end-to-end| entire read must align; no clipping |

|-U [list of the R1 and R2 fastq]|Comma-separated list of files containing unpaired reads (not paired end)|
|--very-fast| -D 5 -R 1 -N 0 -L 22 -i S,0,2.50 (the default is sensitive)|

[~markb],[~iliab],[~elanitec]","30/May/23 11:52 AM;iliab;Percentages of the reads mapped to the codding regions (.trs) are in agreement to the literature.  ""Microbial genomes typically contain a much larger fraction of coding than noncoding DNA. Here, the percentage of coding DNA ranged from 73.54 to 95.54%""([https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0014651]). However, we are missing about 3-5% of short genes (~50-200 bp). Thus, we will first map reads to scaffolds and then calculate coverages based on the coordinates. In addition, we will allow to map up to 10 alignments per reads in order to check the percentage of the ambiguous alignments.

I performed two trial runs with different parameters against three public productions.

 

Productions:
 # Acidiphilium_sp._CAG_727_GCA_000437515.1_23v1.prt
 # Acidithiobacillus_caldus_GCA_000175575.2_23v1.prt
 # Halofilum_ochraceum_GCA_001614315.2_23v1.prt

 

Parameters of diamond blastp:
 # --sensitive --id 50 -e 1e-05 (close to strict parameters used in [https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.02852-18] except I did not filtered based on the alignment length)
 # --sensitive --query-cover 75 --min-score 50 (similar to what we decided for Metacyc)

 

Running time is fast (seconds).

 

Number of hits in 3 productions with 2 parameter sets:
|Productions|ID_50_EVLAUE_10E-5|score_50_qcov_75|
|1|18|135|
|2|110|439|
|3|110|538|

 

For the second set of options, I checked a couple of hits using the sensitive domain search in NCBI (DELTA-BLAST) and got adequate hits.

 

We can us the second option, but I would reduce potential false positive hits by adding more specific but slower blast algorithm (RPSBLAST) or perform reciprocal blast.

Evoops- we are not generating this data during runannotation. We will check with Dev if there is a way to get the evoops for this production? 

Modules- we have this ready

Gene- what does it mean? is it the protein sequence of all the clusters of this isolate? we don't have an annotation named ""gene""

Metacyc_pathways- we don't have this for this production since it's from 20v1, and we only have this for the new productions. We can run this specifically for this production, but it might require some adaptations.

Hi Elanite,
Regarding Jira LAV-467, I need the annotation files to contain the coordinate location along the genome (scaffold) for each annotation(line), with regards to the reference genome (i.e. Pseudomonas_ISID49762_20v1)

It's a specific annotation format called .bed (please see attached examples)
These are the titles of the columns in the .bed file (and the information I need):
Scaffold, start position, end position, annotation name, reading frame, strand

Whenever I do strain comparison, I need the various .bed annotation files to be able to see where SNPs are located within/around the various annotations.
For example this SNP is located within K01239, EvoCOGV2:3296 and IPR036452
 [^Example (Lav-467).pptx] 

I don't remember who wrote the Strain Comparison tool for us, maybe Itai? I think he would know about this.

Ilia pointed out that the results that you want are for strain comparison via Reseq/Sauce pipeline and this was not the current task description and DOD. Additionally, you did not provide a list of productions to compare to the reference genome.  
At this stage, Ilia provided a general bed file for the genes. Using this file and the annotation file, you can find the coordinates of the gene of interest.
Can be found in the same folder (I:\Shared_folder\For Maria\LAV-467):

","21/Mar/23 10:51 AM;mariac;Some questions that came up for us were:

1) Where can we see the percent coverage of the reference (by 5+ reads)

2) I understand that a SNP is only reported if the coverage in that area is 5 SNPs and above. Are there any other such rules and thresholds to be aware of?

3) How can we visualize the read coverage of the reference using IGV?

4) In the results folder, we see three vcf files: filter, filter_norm and filter_norm_without_Ns. What is the difference between them?

5) In the results folder, we see files called sample_distances_shared_alleles.tsv and sample_distances.tsv. How are these distances obtained?

6) Is there any interdependence between scaffold annotation and snp detection? (if don't have one don't have the other)

7) If you can suggest a PHRED score threshold for SNP calling

8) What are Ns in ""SAUCE_no_Ns""? Is it ambiguous bases? Not enough coverage?

9) other things we discussed with Larisa that I forgot to mention

[~larisar] [~elanitec]","22/May/23 10:39 AM;elanitec;Hi [~mariac], please see answers from Itai (Algo)

Hi,
I will deliver a presentation on Wednesday, but I don't think I'll be able to refer to all the details, so I'll just answer here what I know:

1) look at the *.fstat  file (created in Reseq). they are simply a results of ""samtools flagstat""  command.

2) there are some other filters, please have a look  here: http://confluence:8090/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=47153243 (under ""Detailed parameters information) , also http://confluence:8090/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=47153243&focusedCommentId=53542944#comment-53542944

3) add the *.bam files to the IGV and choose ""show coverage track"".

4)-  freebayes_filtered.vcf: filtered results by the parameters I mentioned above.

freebayes_filtered_norm.vcf: see here https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html#norm 
I don't know the 3rd file (filter_norm_without_Ns), I think maybe it is not a result of Reseq/Sauce but of some manual manipulation.
5) the distances are calculated by the number of shared alleles (=same mutations in every 2 samples). sample_distances_shared_alleles.tsv show the raw number and sample_distances.tsv is the same number divided by all alleles.

6) the SNPs are detected by sequence comparison to the reference genome, no need for anything else; but you won't be able to know what is the affection of those SNPs on functions (genes, evocogs...) without annotations.

7) I think a PHRED score of 15 should be enough, maybe even less, but I'm not an expert .

8) I guess an ambiguous base, but I really don't know what  ""SAUCE_no_Ns"" is.

I hope that would help

after several attempts to run the test, we saw the issue resulted by Nexus nginx configuration.

the received error message:

 *+Root cause:+*
 On May 14, we've tried to reduce the amount of ""time out"" received from Nexus during py packages installation. one of our main assumption was that Nginx control this process and the number of requests are determined by the Ngnix.
 Therefore, we've commented the section that refers to the proxy on the Nexus Nginx conf file. After changing the configuration, we were able to pull py packages and we assumed that the amount of time out reduced.
  *__* However, seems that the change, affected other requests (npm) and all npm requests were rejected.
  
 +*Solution:*+
 We've changed back to the previous configuration
  
 +Related configuration [file:+|file://+/]
 *ssh to nexus-node-1 > /etc/nginx/conf.d/nexus.conf*
 We've removed the remarks from the last section (""location / ..."") and restarted in order for the change to take affect.

 Root Cause
 1.Message return to the Kubelet by CRI-O exceeds the maximum allowed by the gPRC connection.
 2.Kubelet fails to communicate with CRI-O and various internal operations could fail as well.
 3.The number of containers is overflowing the max response size of the gRPC client in the OpenShift Node/Kubelet.

This classifier uses different microbiome signatures such as evooges/ KO profiles, strain profiles, diversity of taxa and functions of the samples and so on.

The aim of this task is to look for the scripts of this predictor, understand them, make sure that they works and successfully transfer the scripts to Biomica to support further independent use and future model training. In addition, we would need to obtain the information regarding the scripts.

We would like to discuss two optional scenarios and decide between them: 1. The predictor runs on Evogene grid by CPB personnel. 2. The predictor runs on an independent environment by Biomica (which may require adaptations).

 DoD:
 # Find the script
 # Make sure script is usable and able receive new input data
 # present  to Biomica the rationalle and description of the script in order to decide whether to transfer to 3rd party or build a platform to run locally 

Please update Biomica after each step what is the status.

Transfering the immuno-oncology microbiome-based machine-learning classifier constructed per Biomica’s request,BIOM-246,42200,Task,Closed,BIOM,Biomica,software,drorf,,,High,,nira,SheerliK,SheerliK,17/02/2023 14:52,11/06/2023 07:08,11/06/2023 09:53,,25/04/2023 00:00,0,"IO-predictor is a microbiome-based machine-learning classifier constructed per Biomica’s request.  This predictor is based on the microbiome signature of cancer patients that responded or did not respond to immunotherapy and was built for Biomica.

This classifier uses different microbiome signatures such as evooges/ KO profiles, strain profiles, diversity of taxa and functions of the samples and so on.

The aim of this task is to look for the scripts of this predictor, understand them, make sure that they works and successfully transfer the scripts to Biomica to support further independent use and future model training. In addition, we would need to obtain the information regarding the scripts.

We would like to discuss two optional scenarios and decide between them: 1. The predictor runs on Evogene grid by CPB personnel. 2. The predictor runs on an independent environment by Biomica (which may require adaptations).

 DoD:
 # Find the script
 # Make sure script is usable and able receive new input data
 # present  to Biomica the rationalle and description of the script in order to decide whether to transfer to 3rd party or build a platform to run locally

Please update Biomica after each step what is the status.

Thank you,

Single molecule run upgrade - cloned to Roberto .May,AG-1180,46714,Task,Closed,AG,AgPlenus,software,drorf,,,Medium,,hamutal.e,hamutal.e,hamutal.e,30/04/2023 16:08,01/06/2023 08:07,11/06/2023 09:53,,31/05/2023 00:00,0,"Hi,

In recent months we have increased the number of compounds ordered to AgPlenus.

This resulted in more frequent and bigger single molecule runs. Due to the way the script currently works ([~robertoo] please correct any information I may explain inaccurately), all recent runs got stuck and got an error before transfer to gotsho due to a similar reason - 

one or more of the compounds in the upload had SMILE information that was different than the SMILE data in the db.

As I upload the SMILE in the single run file based on files I get directly from the vendor, in 99/100 cases the correction is the same - replacing the current db SMILE, which is automatically imported from the generic vendor catalog, with the updated version which was provided specifically and directly from the vendor.

Unfortunately at the moment the system does not allow these corrections to be done by the user.

Therefore, every time a run gets stuck (which lately has been every run I did) - I have to contact Roberto so he can find the problematic compound/s, ask me how to correct them and correct them manually.

*Until each error is fixed, the single run data is not pushed to Gotsho by API and I cannot upload the compounds to the chemical bank - thus cannot use them in experiments.*

As the problem is repetitive in nature, we'd love to discuss a more long-term solution with you, both to make our use of the system smoother and to alleviate some of the pressure on Roberto.

Attached is the basic design we requested for crop concat scripts.

Filesystem path  identical to AG-1156.

we need to have two types of systems for image comparison:
 # treatment vs control for all plates (replicates of that treatment)
 # Assembles all treatments of one solvent with all the control 

 

DOD:

prepare image files similar to the attached presentation
 #  Treatment vs control should be all plates consisting of same treatment (described in column #T)  and all control treatments which are the ""solvent"" or ""CONTROL vs"" column meaning each plate should be represented by all treatment replicates and all control replicates as described in slide 1 
 # All treatments vs control. All treatments per single plate that consist of a single solvent should be aggregated into an image cluster. at the end of the cluster should be all the controls of that solvent as described in slide 2. you can use the ""solvent"" column and ""plate_ID"" to generate the cluster.
